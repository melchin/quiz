4. Refactor the code below.
   (do not create functions or constants, code refactor is required only)

### ORIGINAL

```javascript
if (province == "ONTARIO") {
  rate = ONTARIO_RATE;
  amt = base * ONTARIO_RATE;
  calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
} else if (province == "QUEBEC" || province == "ALBERTA") {
  rate = province == "QUEBEC" ? QUEBEC_RATE : ALBERTA_RATE;
  amt = base * rate;
  calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
  if (province == "QUEBEC") {
    points = 2;
  }
} else {
  rate = 1;
  amt = base;
  calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
}
```

### REFACTORED

```javascript
if (province === "ONTARIO") {
  rate = ONTARIO_RATE;
} else if (province === "ALBERTA") {
  rate = ALBERTA_RATE;
} else if (province === "QUEBEC") {
  rate = QUEBEC_RATE;
  points = 2;
} else {
  rate = 1;
}

amt = base * rate;
calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
```

### NOTES

- The task did not allow us to create constants, but a "rates" object would be better than this chain of if/else statements.
- I recognized that all rate constants follow the pattern [PROVINCE]\_RATE, which would make it convenient to use `eval()`. However, this approach is not taken because of the enormous security risks that it introduces: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval
